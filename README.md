# Dynamic Android Malware Analysis

In this repository, we provide all the code and research completed for the Research Paper "Interpretable Android Malware Detection based on Dynamic Analysis
" [link goes here](www.google.com)

## Abstract

Refer to the Data Collection folder to view the code and instruction on how the dataset was created for ML Experiments. The dataset has feature to perform dynamic analysis.
Data Collection phase was divided into 3 sub phases which can be viewed below:
1) APK Collection
2) Feature Collection (System Calls specifically)
3) Dataset Creation

After we created the datasets, all the ML Experiments can be found here:

Large Datasets folder contains experiments which had a dataset of 3000 rows.
Small Datasets folder contains experiments which had a dataset of 1200 rows.
The Class Imbalance folder contains experiments with also 3000 rows but with techniques to address the issue.
