# Dynamic Android Malware Analysis

In this repository, we provide all the code and research completed for the Research Paper [Interpretable Android Malware Detection based on Dynamic Analysis](https://icissp.scitevents.org/)

## Abstract

Refer to the Data Collection folder to view the code and instruction on how the dataset was created for ML Experiments. The dataset has feature to perform dynamic analysis.  
Data Collection phase was divided into 3 sub phases which can be viewed below:  
1) [APK Collection](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/APKCollection/READme.md)
2) [Feature Extraction (System Calls specifically)](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/FeatureCollection/READme.md)
3) [Feature Vector Creation](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/MLDatasetCreation/READme.md)

After we created the datasets, all the ML Experiments with their code, dataset, and results can be found [here](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/tree/main/MLExperiments):
