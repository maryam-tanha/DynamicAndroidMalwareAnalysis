# Machine Learning Experiments with traditional models

## Random Forest and XG Boost Models

All the model.py files contain ML experiments done with RF and XGBooat algorithms. Each model.py file also contains a gridsearch to select the best paramters for the model.  

Each sub folder represents the ratio of benign to malware in training dataset while the ratio is kept 90:10 in testing dataset.

1) Large Datasets folder contains experiments which had a dataset of 3000 rows.
2) Small Datasets folder contains experiments which had a dataset of 1200 rows.  
3) Class Imbalance folder contains experiments with also 3000 rows but with techniques to address the issue.
