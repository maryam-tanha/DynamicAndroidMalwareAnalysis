# Machine Learning Experiments with traditional models

## Random Forest and XG Boost Models

All the model.py files contain ML experiments done with RF and XGBooat algorithms. Each model.py file also contains a gridsearch to select the best paramters for the model.  

1) The MLExperimentRatios folders contains the experiments done with 3 different ratios of benign to malware APKs on a dataset of 3000 APKs.
2) The Class Imbalance folder contains experiments which address class imbalance with techniques like UnderSampling and Class Weights. The experiments in this folder are done on a dataset of 3000 APKs with a 90:10 ratio of Benign to Malware.
