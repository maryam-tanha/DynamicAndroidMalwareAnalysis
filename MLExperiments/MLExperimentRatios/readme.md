### Clarifications on what this folder contains

This folder is for the large datsets that will be created:
The large datasets have 3000 APKs in total in the dataset.csv file

The differentation comes on the ratio of malware and benign in each datasets.

<i>Note: The classic ratio refers to 90% benign and 10% malware ratio</i>

Also note that the samling is implemented in [UnderSampling Folder](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/tree/main/MLExperiments/ClassImbalance/Undersampling)

1) 90_10
   2) This dataset contains 90% benign APK rows (2700 rows) and 10% malware APK rows (300)
   3) Since, the ratio will remain the same in both the training and testing set, we can use the original dataset to create both training and testing sets and maintain the ration of malware to benign APKs.
   4) The model.py code inside the folder is doing just that.
5) 85_15
   6) The next dataset should contain 85% benign and 15% malware in its training set, while the test set has the classic ratio.
   7) The training and testing sets have been split into 2 different datasets.
   7) The training set contains 2700 rows, out which 85% are benign (2295 rows) and 15% are malware (405 rows).
8) 80_20
   9) This dataset contains 80% benign and 20% malware in its training set, while the test set has the classic ratio.
   10) The training and testing sets have been split into 2 different datasets.
   11) The training set contains 2700 rows, out which 80% are benign (2160 rows) and 20% are malware (540 rows).
