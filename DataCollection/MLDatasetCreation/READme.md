# Feature Vector Generation

This Python script generates feature vectors from CSV files containing syscall frequencies. The vectors are created for a classification task, distinguishing between malware and benign samples.

## Usage

1. **System Call Data:**
   - The script expects a file named `unique_syscalls.txt` containing a list of unique system calls.

2. **CSV Files:**
   - CSV files should be organized in specific directories:
     - `benign-features/syscall-info-v1`
     - `malware-features/syscall-info-v1`
     - `benign-features/syscall-info-v2`
   - Update the csv_directories variable based on your directory structure

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Execute the script to read syscall frequencies and generate feature vectors.
     ```bash
     python generate_feature_vectors.py
     ```

## Output

The script creates a CSV file named `final_vectors.csv` containing feature vectors. Each vector includes the filename, a malware indicator (0 for benign, 1 for malware), and syscall frequencies.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Notes

- Ensure the presence of `unique_syscalls.txt`.
- Verify the organization of CSV files in the specified directories.

By running this script, you can generate feature vectors suitable for training a machine learning model to classify malware and benign samples based on syscall frequencies.
