# Data Collection

The data collection has been divided in 3 phases which were:

1) [APK Collection](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/APKCollection/READme.md)
   In this phase we doenloaded our Android APKs (Beningn and Malware) from Androzoo and VirusShare and stored them on our external hard drives.
   The whole process of selecting the sha256 keys to download and then downloading them using async scripts is given in the folder.
   
3) [Feature Collection (System Calls specifically)](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/FeatureCollection/READme.md)
   After we downloaded the APKs, we move on to extract dynamic analysis features from the APKs. This folder will give all relevant details and code of this process.
  
5) [Dataset Creation](https://github.com/maryam-tanha/DynamicAndroidMalwareAnalysis/blob/main/DataCollection/MLDatasetCreation/READme.md)
   After we succesfully extracted dynamic analysis features from the APKs, we move on to create feature vector for our APKs and store them in a dataset. The dataset is later used to all the ML Experiments.
